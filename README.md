# Dotfiles

I run i3 in Linux Mint 21 with most settings unchanged.
I use [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com) modded with
[Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
My current vim config is very bare bones as I'm just migrating back from
emacs.
I most probably will not write a more detailed readme page for this repo.
